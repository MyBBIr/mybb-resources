<p>You've probably noticed that we're running a "security blitz" with MyBB over the coming weeks in order to clear up any outstanding security issues with MyBB.
</p><p>This is the first update we'll be releasing. Dubbed as 1.04, this update fixes a number of key security issues found in the existing code:
</p>
<ul><li>SQL injection with referrer uid (Credited to WDZ)
</li><li>Potential injection on moderation options by a moderator (Credited to imei)
</li><li>Potential issues with private messaging as well as group management interfaces (Credited to imei)
</li><li>A series of vulnerabilities which could potentially allow installations of PHP with register_globals set to on, to be exploited.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
Affected files within this update include:
</p>
<pre>   * global.php
   * managegroup.php
   * moderation.php
   * private.php
