<p>As our ongoing commitment to providing a secure bulletin board, the MyBB Group is releasing an update to MyBB 1.00. This update patches a few security related issues found in the MyBB code.
</p><p>This update has been tagged as 1.01 so that users will know if they've updated or not and the version tracker will show available updates.
</p><p>We recommend that everyone updates their boards as soon as possible due to the fact there is a small amount of public knowledge of these exploits, however we're trying to keep any specific details from being released.
