<p>The MyBB Group presents you with MyBB 1.0. MyBB is a powerful, efficient and free forum package developed in PHP and MySQL. Developed with the end users in mind, you and your subscribers will feel right at home with full control over their accounts as well as your control over your forums.
</p><p>MyBB 1.0 marks the end in along and painful process of various beta releases in our attempt to create a stable working copy of MyBB safe for use in production environments.
</p><p>This release also fixes two sets of important security vulnerabilities discovered in MyBB. imei reported one set of vulnerabilities, which will not be made public under any advisory. The second set, discovered by tk fixes potential SQL injection problems with uncleaned variables. Coinciding with this release as an advisory outlining that these vulnerabilities exist, however no specific information will be released at this stage [details on affected arguments and files].
</p><p>For this reason, we recommend all users update to 1.0 as soon as possible.

<p>We tried to keep the number of changes from PR2 to 1.0 at a bare minimum to ensure that new bugs weren’t created. Noticible changes include:
</p>
<ul><li>A "Find Updated" link in the templates section which allows you to identify any custom templates that you currently have which have been updated since your last upgrade.
</li><li>A new default theme, based on ideas off Chris, Darren and Kilroy. The new theme includes an updated image set and logo.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>

<p>Several things are underway here at the MyBB Group. You’ll be hearing more about this soon, such as where we’re headed with MyBB now, as well as developments with documentation (the wiki), and team structural changes and new positions.
