<p>In something which couldn't have come at a worse time for us with 1.2 going in to beta next week, we're releasing MyBB 1.1.4 - a security update to the MyBB 1.x series. It fixes a moderate risk SQL injection vulnerability affecting MyBB 1.0 to MyBB 1.1.3.
</p><p>We recommend all users upgrade their copy of MyBB to the latest available release.
</p>
<pre>   * Potential SQL injection in usercp.php (imei Web Security)
</pre>
<p><br />
</p><p>The release on the MyBB site has also been updated to 1.1.4.
</p><p>Update instructions are in the next post, including a list of changed files (and a ZIP archive of them) as well as manual patching instructions for those of you who have customized their code.
</p><p>I was only notified of this issue within the past hour and I am unaware of any widespread knowledge of it. It is a small fix for what is debatable as being something partly to blame on how PHP works and its treatment of 'true' and '1'.
