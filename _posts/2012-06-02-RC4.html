<p>Release Candidate 4 is considered a stable major release of MyBB, even though it sported the "Release Candidate" tag.  RC4 was released on 4 October 2004.  By this time, MyBB sported many of the features seen in the <a href="{{ site.url }}/Features.html" title="Features">Features</a> list today.  Although it was a stable release, there were a couple of significant but not critical bugs.
</p><p>One of the major features included in this version is <a href="{{ site.url }}/Moderating_Options.html#Inline_Thread_Moderation" title="Moderating Options">inline moderation</a>.  This allowed Forum Staff to easily select multiple threads or posts and moderate them in the same way all at once.
