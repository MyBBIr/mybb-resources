<p>As some of you saw, when these forums were attacked, there has been the discovery of another serious security exploit in MyBB.
</p><p>Soon after the boards were exploited, backups of the forum were restored and the discovery process began. Due to access logs being completely useless (Corrupt), I took to the code and found the potential vulnerability the attacker exploited.
</p><p>Available immediately, we're announcing a security update for MyBB dubbed MyBB 1.03. This exploit affects ALL COPIES OF MYBB including previous versions. We recommend everybody update their board as soon as possible.
</p><p>The update fixes the found SQL injection vulnerability (Critical) as well as several other medium priority vulnerabilities recently discovered. (Due to be released tomorrow anyway)
</p><p>Affected files:
</p>
<pre>   * global.php
   * search.php
   * usercp.php
   * inc/functions.php (Version number change)
</pre>
