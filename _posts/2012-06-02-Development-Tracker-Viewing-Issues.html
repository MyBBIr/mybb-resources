<p>The Tracker has a number of ways you can view issues with MyBB - via Custom Queries, Filters or via a Roadmap.
</p><p>When viewing a list of issues, at the top of the sidebar on the right of the list, the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dev.mybb.com/projects/mybb/issues?set_filter=1">View all issues</a> link will return you to the default list of issues. This is useful if you're using a filter and you want to get back. The default view shows all open issues.
</p>

<p>Custom queries are saved filters that are used by the MyBB Team to easily manage their workflow. They include things like assignments to an entire history of fixed issues. You can use these custom queries to track the team's progress to the next milestone.
</p><p><b>Development Queries</b>
<br />These custom queries aid the Development Team.
</p>
<dl><dd> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dev.mybb.com/projects/mybb/issues?query_id=49">Dev: Assignments</a></b> <br />When a developer prepares to fix an issue, they assign it to themselves to take responsibility for it and so that others know they'll be fixing it. The Dev: Assignments query lists issues that developers have been assigned to - it contains all open issues grouped by the developer's name so that it is easy to see which issue is being fixed by who. <br /><br />Developers can use this to see what issues have been assigned to them, which ones they still need to be fixed or whether an issue has some feedback to it all from one list.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dev.mybb.com/projects/mybb/issues?query_id=51">Dev: Feedback</a></b> <br />After a developer adds a commit, an SQA team member checks that it does fix the issue it intended to fix. If SQA finds that it doesn't quite fix it, the status of the issue is changed to feedback. This query lists all issues that require feedback. <br /><br />A developer can use this query to see whether any of their work requires revisiting.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dev.mybb.com/projects/mybb/issues?query_id=48">Dev: Fixed Issues</a></b> <br />This query shows all fixed issues (resolved or closed) since we started to use the tracker. It is ordered by when it was last updated (recent appears first).
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dev.mybb.com/projects/mybb/issues?query_id=50">Dev: Unassigned Issues</a></b> <br />The Unassigned Issues query will show all open issues on the tracker that a developer hasn't been assigned to. Developers can use this query to see which issues they can fix next while not affecting other developer's work.
</dd></dl>
<p><b> SQA Queries</b>
<br />The SQA custom queries help the SQA team manage their workload.
</p>
<dl><dd> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dev.mybb.com/projects/mybb/issues?query_id=41">SQA: Assignments</a></b> <br />After an issue is created and confirmed by SQA, an SQA team member is then chosen to look after it. They must ensure that the commit the developer adds for the issue fixes it. This query lists all SQA assignments grouped by team member that have yet to be closed. <br /><br />SQA team members can use this query to see which issues need attention.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dev.mybb.com/projects/mybb/issues?query_id=42">SQA: Work Queue</a></b> <br />The SQA work queue query lists all issues that are classed as 'new'. These issues need a team member to confirm that they actually exist or whether they are not a bug with MyBB.
</dd></dl>

<p>Filters appear at the top of the list of issues in the tracker. They do exactly as their name describes - they help you filter issues into your own settings.
</p><p>The default list of issues are filtered by open issues only. You can change this by adding a filter (top right of the issues list) and changing its parameters. You can add as many filters as you like - who made the issue, who it was assigned to, when it was created or which version it was reported in. There are many filters you can choose from to get the information you need - and you can eve choose which columns you want to display too in the options.
</p><p>Once you've selected which filters you want to apply to the tracker, you just have to press the "Apply" link (just underneath the filter options). Once you hit apply, the issues list will sort itself to your filters. You can then save the filters as a custom query for later use (it will appear in the sidebar to the right) or you can clear the filters to get back to the default issues list.
</p>

<p><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dev.mybb.com/projects/mybb/versions/">Roadmaps</a></b> are an important part of our tracker - they are special pages which list which issues belong to which version of MyBB. They're also useful to show which issues were fixed in previous versions too.
</p><p>Roadmaps are available for all MyBB milestones. To view them, click on the "Roadmaps" tab (alongside Overview, Activity, Issues, New Issues etc. at the top of the page). At first, you'll only see the next milestones, but in the sidebar to the right are options which you can use to view all other milestones. Check the "Show completed versions" box and hit the apply button and all previous versions of MyBB will become available.
</p><p>When you're viewing a roadmap for a milestone, it lists all of the issues that are assigned to that version. It also tells you whether the issue is closed or open and what percentage each of them make up. If the closed percent is almost at 100, then more than likely that milestone is ready to be released to the general public. To the right of the Roadmap view there will be a list of categories each issue is placed in. This can be changed by the dropdown box above the list of categories to assignee or author and more. The green bar tracks open vs. closed issues.
