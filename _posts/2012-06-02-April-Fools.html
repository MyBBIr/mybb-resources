<h1><span class="mw-heading" id="Introduction"> Introduction </span></h1><p>Occasionally, the MyBB Group puts on an April Fools joke.
</p>
<br />

<h1><span class="mw-heading" id="2007"> 2007: Microsoft Partnership </span></h1>

<h2><span class="mw-heading" id="2007_Introduction"> Introduction </span></h2>
<p>SYDNEY, Australia, April 1, 2007 - Today the MyBB Group are proud to announce a strategic partnership between the MyBB Group and the Redmond based Microsoft Corporation.
</p><p>The MyBB Group are proud to have formed an alliance with Microsoft as this can guarantee the future availability of MyBB with quick and further optimized releases backed from a company with strong roots in the area of software development.
</p><p>With this partnership MyBB will be transformed in to an ASP.NET web application powered by the MSSQL database server. ASP.NET is a world class web development language used behind some of the webs biggest sites and coupled with MSSQL it is an enterprise-class software development platform. (This will replace the PHP and MySQL editions of MyBB)
</p><p>The new requirements to run MyBB will be a Microsoft Windows Server operating system with Internet Information Services.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="2007_Pricing"> Pricing </span></h2>
<p>The MyBB Group will also be developing lite and commercial versions of MyBB including:
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Lite version</b> - Basic functionality, does not support multiple forums (only one forum), unlimited posts &amp; threads, no support for attachments, no member list, no calendar, no polls, no plugin system.
</li><li> <b>Full version ($249 USD)</b> - Full MyBB functionality.
</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="2007_Availability"> Availability </span></h2>
<p>The new ASP.NET versions of MyBB will be available within the coming months. More information will be provided at a later stage.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="2007_New_Administration_Control_Panel"> New Administration Control Panel </span></h2>
<p>You've been waiting for it, we've been waiting to talk about it and we're excited that now we can actually talk about it.
</p><p>With our partnership with Microsoft we have totally refined the Administration Panel, building it directly in to the Microsoft Windows operating system. You can remotely administer your forum from any Windows operating system using the Microsoft Management Console which contains a high level of integration and design to make administration much easier.

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="2007_Active_Directory_Integration"> Active Directory Integration </span></h2>
<p>By rewriting MyBB in to ASP.NET we gain the added functionality of being able to further integrate MyBB in to common workplace systems, for example Microsoft's Active Directory.
</p><p>Active Directory is an LDAP based directory database for users, groups, security and computer information for an entire computer enterprise or business. Active Directory can also be used as an authentication method for defining Windows logons and access policies.
</p><p>MyBB tightly integrates with Active Directory services - your corporate and enterprise users need not have two accounts on your network - one single sign on will work for both your corporate network and installation of MyBB.
</p><p><a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-17923.html">Discuss this announcement</a>.
</p><p>Thank you for your continued support and we're looking forward to an exciting future.

<h1><span class="mw-heading" id="2010"> 2010: (Internal Staff Only Prank) Simple Machines Forum and MyBB To Merge </span></h1>
<p>On April 1st, 2AM in Australia, Dennis decided he would prank the staff by posting this on the internal staff forums.
</p><p>"I think I might have mentioned this to a few of you in the past few weeks, but we just got confirmation of this last night.
</p><p>Chris and I have been in private discussions with the SMF development team, and we agree that both development teams are way too small for efficient development of a free modern web application that can compete in the forum software industry. As an example, we delayed MyBB 1.6 for nearly half a year because of lack of resources, and on the other side SMF's 2.0 has been in development since 2005. With the way web development is evolving these days, the old-fashioned release cycle we have cannot keep up with the latest technologies.
</p><p>Both of our groups have major releases coming up in the near future, for us with 1.6, and SMF with 2.0. We have agreed that once we have both released our products, that we will be merging together to produce a new forum software (we were due for a rewrite anyway with MyBB 2.0, and also SMF's 2.0 framework was developed in 2005 and is frankly becoming obsolete even before it is released).
</p><p>The big downfall is that SMF wants to take over and drive the project after the merger. Chris and I have finally decided to be OK with that and we have submitted to them because we want to take advantage of the additional people and their experience, so that we can concentrate on the development, and hopefully have our ideas heard along the way, but it cannot be guaranteed.
</p><p>We just wanted to let you know so that you would be prepared when this happens (probably in mid-summer). We also want to know whether or not you will be on board with us in this merger, please leave your decision/opinion.
</p><p>Edit: They've just set up a private forum for discussion on the merger on their site, so if you are on board, please register there <a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/">http://www.simplemachines.org/community/</a> and post your username here and I'll get them to add you to the forum's access list."
</p><p>You can read the thread it got, here: <a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-67184.html">http://community.mybb.com/thread-67184.html</a>
Note: This does not represent any staffs opinions, nor MyBB's in general, it was just an April Fools Day prank.

<h1><span class="mw-heading" id="2011"> 2011: Pirate Language Prank </span></h1>
<p>On April 1st, 2011 chaos struck the MyBB Community forums, everything was..... Pirate?
</p><p>The staff decided, nothing wrong with a joke and changed the language pack on the community forum to a specially made pirate language pack (made by Tomm). Everyone saw everything in pirate language... Nothing was the same!
</p><p>The pirate pack lasted over 48hours to allow everyone in every timezone to get pranked. In addition, after popular demand, Tomm released his language pack as a public download, allowing anyone to change their forums language.
