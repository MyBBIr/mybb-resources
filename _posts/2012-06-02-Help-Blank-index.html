<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Getting_a_blank_index_page.3F">Getting a blank index page?</span></h1>
<p>There are four common reasons listed below for why you might be getting a blank index page.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Another_file_is_called_index">Another file is called index</span></h2>
<p>Usually your host will give priority to html files when deciding what page to set as your home page so if your receiving a blank or unusual index page you should first check that there is not already a file called index.html or index.htm in your forum directory. If there is then try renaming or deleting the file. This may also be caused by files named home on some servers.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Your_hosting_does_not_support_Gzip_compression">Your hosting does not support Gzip compression</span></h2>
<p>Often if your host does not support Gzip compression and you have it enabled you will get a blank page. Read <a href="Help:Gzip" title="Help:Gzip">help:gzip</a> for more information on how to dissable Gzip compression.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="There_is_a_problem_with_your_.htaccess_file">There is a problem with your .htaccess file</span></h2>
<p>If the above two solutions don't work then there might be an issue with your .htaccess file, try renaming it to htaccess.txt and see if that helps.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="You.27ve_not_got_any_templates">You've not got any templates</span></h2>
<p>View the source of a page on your forum. If you just see this:
</p>
<pre>&lt;!-- start: index --&gt; 
 
&lt;!-- end: index --&gt;</pre>
<p>It means no templates have been imported. If this is a fresh install, and you have not added any content to your forum yet, reupload a new copy of <em>./install/resources/mybb_theme.xml</em>, make sure it's uploaded properly and doesn't have a size of 0kb, and install again. <strong>This will reinstall the forum from scratch</strong> so do not do this if you have added content to your forum. If you have added content to your forum and do not want to reinstall, make a support thread and we'll find the best way of solving the problem.
