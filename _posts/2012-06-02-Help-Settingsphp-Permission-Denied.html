<p>The error occurs when you try to save settings or possibly when activating/deactivating plugins:
</p>
<dl><dd> Warning: fopen(./inc/settings.php): Failed to open stream: Permission denied in /path/to/mybb/admin/settings.php on line X.
</dd><dd> Warning: fwrite(): supplied argument is not a valid stream resource in /path/to/mybb/admin/settings.php on line X+1.
</dd><dd> Warning: fclose(): supplied argument is not a valid stream resource in /path/to/mybb/admin/settings.php on line X+2.
</dd></dl>
<p>Solution:
<a href="{{ site.url }}/HowTo_Chmod.html" title="HowTo Chmod">CHMOD</a> the <a href="Inc/settings.php" title="Inc/settings.php">inc/settings.php</a> file to 666 (in other words, make it so that the web server can write to inc/settings.php)
</p>
