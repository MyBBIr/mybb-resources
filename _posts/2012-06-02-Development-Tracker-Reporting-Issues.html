<p>When you've found an issue with MyBB, head over to the development site, log in and then click on the "New Issue" tab.
</p><p>There are lots of options that you can select here, but you'll only need a few of them. Here are a few guidelines about what to do when you report a new issue.
</p>
<ul><li> Enter a descriptive subject for the issue. Try not to be vague or too ambitious - creating an issue such as <i>Javascript issue</i> isn't great, but writing <i>Javascript issue when creating a new user</i> is pretty much ideal. Writing <i>Javascript issue line 264 general.js in the acp when creating a new user</i> is a bit too much detail(!). The best subject title will describe the problem in a short sentence.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> When entering the description of your problem, try to give us as much information as you can. If you can remember how you found the issue (<i>reproduction steps</i>) then please include that too. There is a file upload box too where you can add screenshots if you can. <br /><br />If your problem includes an error message, whether it's something on screen or an SQL error, then please include that too.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The next step is to select a category for the issue. This is normally where you found the problem. Select an area from the list, and if it isn't there, put it as <i>other</i>.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Set the <i>Reproducibility</i> - tell us how often you find this problem.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Set the <i>Reported In MyBB Version</i> - tell us which version of MyBB this problem affects. It affects all versions, select the latest one.
</li></ul>
<p>That's all there is to it. Please <b>do not set assignee or target versions</b>, start or due dates and estimated time as these are for the MyBB Team to choose from. Setting these by yourself can mess around with our roadmaps and targets!
</p><p>If you can provide more details, such as browser, PHP details and database information then please include it - especially if there is an javascript, PHP warning or SQL error in your problem.
</p><p><br />
