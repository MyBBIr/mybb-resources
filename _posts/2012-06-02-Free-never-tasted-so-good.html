<p>MyBB was originally meant to be commercial software.  However, in 2003, he-who-got-his-head-shaved (also known as Chris Boulton) reversed the plans and vowed to make MyBB a free product (which it still is today).

<h2><span class="mw-heading" id="The_move_to_GPL"> The move to GPL </span></h2>
<p>In October 2008, the MyBB Group re-released MyBB with a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_3">GNU GPL v3</a> license! This change was pushed after the KDE Forums showed interest in using MyBB. A requirement for them was an open source software.

<h2><span class="mw-heading" id="The_move_to_LGPL"> The move to LGPL </span></h2>
<p>When MyBB 1.6 was released, MyBB was then officially released using the Lesser General Public License! This was done to solve legalities around paid plugins and themes.

<p>If you go on the community forums, and type "Free never tasted so good" it will become a link to this wiki page. <a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-109939.html">This was implemented after Booher suggested it in December of 2011.</a>
