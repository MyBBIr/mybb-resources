<p>Due to a low risk browser based cross-site scripting vulnerability found in MyBB, we're releasing a security update to the MyBB 1.1.x series. The exact vulnerability allows cross-site scripting by invalid input in to an avatar URL which will then cause certain browsers (Internet Explorer) to execute that input.
</p><p>We recommend all users upgrade their copy of MyBB to the latest available release.
</p><p>The release on the MyBB site has also been updated to 1.1.7.
</p><p>Update instructions are in the next post, including a list of changed files (and a ZIP archive of them) as well as manual patching instructions for those of you who have customized their code.
