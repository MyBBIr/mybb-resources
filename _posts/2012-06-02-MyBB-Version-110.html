<p>Initially, we didn't plan to release a bug fix related update until the MyBB 1.2 feature release. Thanks to the efforts of one of our new team members, Michael S., who went through the trouble of patching a few of the more common and annoying problems with 1.0x, we are releasing this update.
</p><p>This update is also the next newest update in our "security blitz" with MyBB and fixes several known and potential security issues. We're hoping this will be the last in our recent wave of security updates. imei Security Research is credited for the discovery of a few of these security related issues.
</p><p>This release also includes some small changes to the search functionality of MyBB, ensuring that it should run on larger sites without too many issues. Functionality remains the same, but these changes are temporary until the release of 1.2, which contains updated searching capabilities (including a huge boost in performance over this version)
</p><p>As this release is essentially a security based release, we recommend everyone update their boards as soon as possible.
</p><p>We won't be providing manual code changes for this release (sorry), because of the number of code changes. For anyone who runs a customized board (code modifications), I'll be writing a small article on my advice for updating.
</p><p>Update instructions are in the next post, including a list of changed files (and a ZIP archive of them). The MyBB website has also been updated.
