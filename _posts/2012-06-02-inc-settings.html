<p>The <b>inc/settings.php</b> file contains a cache of all the settings of the board (stored in the <a href="{{ site.url }}/Database_Tables.html#mybb_settings" title="Database Tables">mybb_settings</a> table). You should not manually edit this file.
</p><p>This file is generated on the <a href="{{ site.url }}/Installing.html" title="Installing">installation</a> and also every time the settings are updated in the Admin CP, as well as during the upgrade process.
</p><p>If you have accidentally erased this file, just login to the Admin CP, navigate into the settings, and just update the settings.
</p><p>This file should always remain writable, as it is written to each time settings are updated.
</p>
