<p>Although this was supposed to be a minor version to precede the release of <a href="{{ site.url }}/100.html" title="1.00">1.00</a>, this turned out to be more of a major version.  PR2 revealed major changes in terms of coding to the public since the release of <a href="{{ site.url }}/RC4.html" title="RC4">RC4</a> (<a href="{{ site.url }}/PR1.html" title="PR1">PR1</a> was the private beta release that preceded PR2).
</p><p>There were also major changes in terms of the MyBB Group.  There were several new members who were recruited onto the MyBB Group as Support Team members, and a few eventually made it onto the Development Team.  The MyBB group also started to work on a Subversion (SVN) server, as FTP would prove impractical with a development team of that size.
</p><p>One of the main new coding advances was the MyBB core class.  This class ($mybb) was the repository for almost all the data that MyBB would receive.  It stored cleaned variables from GET and POST forms, as well as information about the current user and usergroup, and settings.  This allowed MyBB to become much more secure.
</p><p>The original PR2 release was 30 August 2005.  A bug-fix release known as <b>PR2 Revision 686</b> was released on 3 September 2005.  A security update was released on 1 November 2005.
